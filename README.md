#  Handwritten Signature Matching 
Description:
Handwritten Signature Matching is a computer vision project that aims to automate the process of verifying signatures by analyzing their similarity. Leveraging the power of deep learning and cosine similarity concepts, this project utilizes the ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract meaningful features from handwritten signatures.

The project workflow begins with a dataset of handwritten signatures, which are preprocessed to enhance their quality and reduce noise. The signatures are then fed into the ResNet50 CNN, a powerful deep learning model that has been pretrained on a large-scale image classification task. By leveraging transfer learning, the model is capable of extracting high-level features and representations from the input signatures.

Once the signatures have been encoded using the ResNet50 CNN, the cosine similarity metric is employed to quantify the similarity between two signatures. The cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, in this case, the feature vectors obtained from the ResNet50 CNN. By calculating the cosine similarity, the project determines the degree of resemblance or similarity between two signatures.

The output of the project is presented as a percentage value or a similarity score, indicating the level of matching between the input signature and the reference signature. A higher percentage or score suggests a closer match, while a lower value indicates a greater dissimilarity.
